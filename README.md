The sinking of the Titanic was a catastrophic event that resulted in a large loss of life. Although there is some element of luck in survival, it has been observed that some passengers appear to be more likely to survive than others. This triggered an in-depth study of factors affecting passenger survival rates, which has important implications for future maritime safety and passenger survival strategies. The goal of the research is to build a predictive model that uses passenger data (such as name, age, gender, socioeconomic class, etc.) to predict whether a passenger will survive. To solve this problem, research has used a variety of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines, KNN algorithms, naive Bayes classifiers, decision trees, random forests, perceptrons, artificial neural networks, and RVM or correlation vector machines wait. By comparing the performance of these algorithms, it is possible to find the model that best fits the problem and thus more accurately predict whether the other 418 passengers will survive
